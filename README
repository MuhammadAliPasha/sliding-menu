SlidingMenu
============

An Android library that extends FragmentActivity to create a menu that slides out from the left hand side of the activity.
While it's called SlidingMenu, it can really hold any 2 layouts or fragments. It's pretty easy to implement and has relatively few options at the moment, check the SlidingMenuTest project to see an implementation.

The only absolutely required function is to call setLayoutIds(int menuLayoutId, int contentLayoutId) in your activity's OnCreate before the call to super.OnCreate then do everything else like normal.
You can wire up the toggle to any click/touch/etc event by calling toggleMenu();
